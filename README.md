# Personal Website ![v1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.0.0-blue.svg)
Hi! Thanks for checking out this repo! This is the first version of my personal website. I created it in 2013 after I started taking on more web development tasks at work and I realized that I really enjoyed making websites. I kept it minimal, using only HTML and CSS.
